1. User opens page. be shown map of USA and CA. cities in our database show as bold dots (like on a real map). at the top are the filter selection bars (like airbnb... select your dates, select weather preference, parks per 100k, internet speed, etc etc. )
2. Map highlights cities that match the filters by making those dots big bold and blue, and other dots small and gray. 
3. When user hovers over one of the dots, we show a card [like this one](https://ant.design/components/card/). Title of city at top of card, then image of city, then the data we have on it, then description of the city, and at the bottom of the card a big 'SEARCH ON AIRBNB' button. 
4. When they click the airbnb button it takes them to the airbnb search page for that city. [Example](https://www.airbnb.com/s/Chattanooga--TN--United-States/homes?tab_id=home_tab&refinement_paths%5B%5D=%2Fhomes&date_picker_type=calendar&query=Chattanooga%2C%20TN%2C%20United%20States&place_id=ChIJheeDikBgYIgRqiiHiR8mcSQ&checkin=2021-02-03&checkout=2021-02-25&adults=2&source=structured_search_input_header&search_type=autocomplete_click)
